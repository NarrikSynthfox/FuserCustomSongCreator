## Introduction

A small UI to create custom songs for Fuser! Requires [Fuser Song Loader](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserSongLoader/) to function.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elenasayshi/FuserCustomSongCreator.git
cd FuserCustomSongCreator
./build.bat
```
`Fuser_CustomSongCreator.sln` should be generated under the `FuserCustomSongCreator/build` folder.
